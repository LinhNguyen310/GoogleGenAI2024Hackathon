## How to  Run
You will need to run 2 servers one for the backend and one for the frontend.
Each are in their own folders (./frontend and ./backend) and have their respective readme.mds. Please follow the instructions within the respective readme's to install and run the projects.

## Inspiration
We created Campfire Storyteller because we understand that starting is often the hardest part of any creative process. This app is designed to help people unleash their imagination more freely and effectively. We believe in empowering storytellers by providing them with a powerful tool that helps them transition from the daunting blank page to a flourishing story, enriching the storytelling community.
## What it does
Campfire Storyteller leverages advanced prompt chaining and iterative generation to help users craft compelling stories. It provides a friendly interface where users can start with a simple idea and expand it into a detailed narrative, making the art of storytelling accessible to everyone, regardless of their previous writing experience.
## How we built it
The backend of Campfire Storyteller is built with Node.js and MongoDB, ensuring robust data handling and scalability. We integrated the Gemini API for its advanced capabilities in prompt chaining and iterative generation, which maximizes the potential of each story. For the frontend, we chose Nuxt for its versatility in building user-friendly interfaces and Three.js for dynamic visual effects, creating an engaging user experience.
## Challenges we ran into
Our team, hailing from various countries, faced significant challenges in coordination and communication. The diversity brought differences in work culture and time zones, creating hurdles in collaboration. Moreover, the age gap among team members presented unique perspectives and approaches, enriching the project but requiring careful integration of ideas.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the challenges, our team's ability to come together and collaborate effectively is our proudest achievement. We have managed to blend our diverse backgrounds and skills into a cohesive and innovative product that stands testament to the power of effective teamwork and mutual respect.
## What we learned
Throughout the development of Campfire Storyteller, we gained deeper insights into the capabilities of the Gemini API, enhancing our technical proficiency. We also learned to navigate and leverage our diverse team dynamics, which enriched our personal and professional growth.
## What's next for Campfire Storyteller
Looking forward, we aim to enhance Campfire Storyteller by expanding its features to include story sharing, liking, and voting, fostering a community of engaged and supportive storytellers. We plan to further develop the app's core engine, training more sophisticated models to deliver even higher quality and more creatively diverse outputs. By continually refining and expanding our tool, we hope to unlock even greater potential in storytellers worldwide.
